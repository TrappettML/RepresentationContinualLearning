# RepresentationSimilarityCL

## Description
This project will analyze the representations between networks using different levels and types of sparsity across many different continual learning tasks.
The goal of the project will be state which types of representations are usefull for remembering and transfering knowledge across tasks. 
We want to compare gating different levels of sparsity as well as to other typical CL techniques, EWC, SI, etc.

In addition we will compare these techniques in the SL and RL regimes to see if learning rules impact the representation.
